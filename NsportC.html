                <h4>I led a team of 6 UI/UX designers designing NsportC applications across iOS, Android, and Web since September 2016. The design team focused on discovering user requirements and creating delightful user experience.<br><br>Up until November 2016, I led efforts to evolve the design from basically nothing to hi-fidelity prototypes. In addition, I led the team to conduct market research and potential-user interviews to address user pain-points and ensure there is a market opportunity.</h4>

                <h3>Three Months:<br> From Zero To Hero</h3>
                <h4>In September 2016, our client approached us with two primary goals - to design the user interfaces that combines functionality and usability for their products; and to discover true user needs in order to help them promote the product and find business partners.<br><br>In order to let the development team start as early as possible and help the client catch this market opportunity, our team was under high pressure to move forward fast. We were aimed to deliver both the website design and mobile app design by the start of December 2016, which meant we only had about 3 months to generate hi-fidelity prototypes. To ensure that we were able to provide high quality designs and beat the deadlines at the same time, I created a project plan to set milestone goals.</h4>

                <h3>What is<br>"In Suspicion" of Concussion</h3>
                <h4>We started the discovery phase quickly. Since this product is related to teenager sports players' health, there might be legal limitations of what we can do. To understand what the legal requirements are, our team researched on regulations of high school coaches' responsibilities. From our research, we found two major design constraints:<br><br><strong>1. If a teenager player is in suspicion of having concussion, the coach should remove the player from play immediately.<br>2. Only medical professonals should determine whether a teenager player has concussion.</strong></h4>
                <img id="Lstoryboard" class="lazyload" data-src="img/N/regulation.png" alt="">
                <h4>However, removing players and sending players to doctors once any incidents happen seemed to be unrealistic. Unlike many other injuries, concussion often cannot be determined by a player's physical situation. So our assumption is that, many times, coaches are unsure about the possibility of concussion if a teenager player gets hit in the head or fall to the floor. If our assumption is right, then the purpose of our product is to become an assessment tool that helps coaches determine whether a player should be suspected of having concussion.</h4>

                <h3>User Intervews & Personas</h3>
                <h4>We kicked off the user research right after the discovery phase. To confirm our assumption, we interviewed with two coaches, Joe and Max. Both of them have been high school coaches for over 10 years, and they have children that play in high school teams. Both as coaches and parents, they talked about their experience handling teenager player incidents and what they expect from our product. From our user interviews, we confirmed our assumption and realized that our product could potentially help both coaches and players' parents. Here are some major take-ins:<br><br><strong>1. Our assumption is correct. Coaches can hardly tell whether a player should be "suspected" to have concussion.<br>2. Although state laws regulates that coaches must go through a concussion training, but only a few can remember the details of the training.<br>3. Parents think the pre-medical records are important even if the incident does not lead to concussion, because they believe that the real problem is the overall brain health, not how many concussions happened in the past.</strong><br><br>After interviewing with coaches, we decided to design two persona types - primary persona for middle school or high school coaches and secondary persona for teenager players' parents - in order to prioritise who we will be focusing on in the early stage. We used personas constantly to make decisions, set priorities, and create user scenarios.</h4>

                <h4>For our primary persona type, we developed two personas varying by their coaching experience. This variable could greatly affect the behavior and experience using our product. A more experienced coach may have more awareness of each player's health status, while a less experienced coach may miss important indicators that a player's health status is unstable. We also developed a secondary persona to represent teenager players' parents. We discussed the personas with our client to understand more of the big picture and started drawing workflow diagrams.</h4>

                <h4>Using our primary persona - coach's role - as a breakthrough point, we created workflow diagrams to visualize the users end-to-end experience and map the product workflow. The workflow diagram defines how different types of users interact with the product and how they collaborate to accomplish tasks, as well as how information flows between users and the product. Later we had a conversation about the workflow with our client to confirm that we were running towards the right direction.</h4>

                  <p class="lead">Onboarding is the initial step for coaches to enjoy our product. While designing the registration process, we discovered that asking coaches to type in every player's demographical information may be too much, especially for coaches who manage multiple sports teams. To alleviate the burden on coaches, we ask parents to register and put in the demographic information for their children. At the same time, we are giving them access to all pre-medical records/test results. Once a coach add all players on the team, their parents will receive an email inviting them to register and type in players' information. Once a parent completes the registration process, his children will be officially registered.</p>

Players will be shown in 4 types of status - "not registered" means the player's parent has not completed the registration; "normal" means no signs of concussion; "in treatment" means a player is confirmed injured and cannot play; and "in observation" means a player is suspected of having concussion according to our assessment tool and needs to see a medical professional for further diagnosis.</p>

                <h3>Determine "In Suspicion"<br>Assessment Tool</h3>
                <h4>Now our focus falls onto the word "in suspicion" again. We researched on concussion training materials and asked opinions from experienced coaches. To determine the mental state of a teenager player and the possibility of concussion, coaches normal ask three types of questions to the players when an incident happens:<br><br>1. Basic questions related to the player's demographical information. For example, "what is your mother's name?" and "what grade are you in?".<br>2. Cognitive questions to test the logical thinking of the player. For example, "can you repeat reversely of the numbers listed here?" and "can you tell me what is 3 times 5 minus 6?"<br>3. Motional tasks to see if the player can control the body balance. For example, "on a firm surface, stand on single foot" and "one foot behind other".<br><br>The answers from experienced coaches coincided with our client's research. Because timing is important to further treatment of concussion, coaches suggested the total assessment time should be less than 5 minutes.</h4>

                <h4>First, once a player is registered completely on our product, either the coach or the player's parent will do a benchmark test to get the player's response in normal status. When an incident happens, the coach or the assistant coach will use our application to conduct the assessment test. Then our algorithm (produced by our client) will compare the assessment test results with the benchmark test results of the player to decide whether the test is successful or failed.</h4>

                <div class="row gifs">
                <div class="col-sm-6 wow fadeInDown text-center">
                  <img id="AC" class="lazyload" data-src="img/N/sp.gif" alt="Generic placeholder image">
                  <p class="lead">On our first version, we use the alphabetical order for the player list. According to user feedback, "order by status" is a more intuitive way for them to see who can play and who cannot.</p>
                </div><!-- /.col-lg-4 -->
                
                <div class="col-sm-6 wow fadeInDown text-center">
                  <img id="AC" class="lazyload" data-src="img/N/ti.gif" alt="Generic placeholder image">
                   <p class="lead">When we test the transactions of pages, an actual coach pointed out that teenage player may look similar on small profile pictures, so we added player names to identify each player.</p>
                </div><!-- /.col-lg-4 -->
          </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    </div></div>
